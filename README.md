# Reactive Website

Reactive Website is an open source website builder that’s built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your website easy. With this app, you can create multiple websites, share them with recruiters through a unique link and print as PDF, all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your website, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode website? It’s as easy as editing 3 values and you’re done. You don’t need to wait to see your changes either. Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your website and gets updated in real time.
